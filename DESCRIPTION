Description: We developed a novel algorithm, XBSeq, where a statistical
        model was established based on the assumption that observed
        signals are the convolution of true expression signals and
        sequencing noises. The mapped reads in non-exonic regions are
        considered as sequencing noises, which follows a Poisson
        distribution. Given measureable observed and noise signals from
        RNA-seq data, true expression signals, assuming governed by the
        negative binomial distribution, can be delineated and thus the
        accurate detection of differential expressed genes.
